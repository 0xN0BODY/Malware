===============================================================================

# What happened?

All your files have been encrypted and made inaccessible. This includes 
(but is not limited to) Photos, Documents and Spreadsheets.

# Why Me?

This is not a personal attack. You have been targeted because of the inadequate 
security provided by your vendor ({VENDOR_NAME}).

# What now?

Visit your {VENDOR_NAME} machine in a webbrowser and follow the instructions to
get your files back.

# Important Message for {VENDOR_NAME}

All your affected customers have been targeted using a zero-day vulnerability in
your product. We offer you two options to mitigate this (and future) damage:

1) Make a bitcoin payment of {VENDOR_AMOUNT} BTC to {VENDOR_ADDRESS}:

You will receive all details about this zero-day vulnerability so it 
can be patched. A detailed report will be sent to {VENDOR_EMAIL}.

2) Make a bitcoin payment of {VENDOR_AMOUNT_FULL} BTC to {VENDOR_ADDRESS}:

You will receive a universal decryption master key (and instructions) that can
be used to unlock all your clients their files. Additionally, we will also send
you all details about the zero-day vulnerability to {VENDOR_EMAIL}.

Upon receipt of payment for either option, all information will be sent to
you in a timely fashion.

There is no way to contact us.
These are our only offers.
Thanks for your consideration.

Greetings, 
DEADBOLT team.
